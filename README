A complete, production-ready implementation of **CMMC 2.0 Level 1 & Level 2** security policies for Fleet device management platform targeting macOS 15 systems.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Download** the appropriate policy file for your CMMC level:
   - `cmmc-policies-level-1.yml` - Essential cybersecurity practices for Federal Contract Information (FCI)
   - `cmmc-policies-level-2.yml` - Comprehensive cybersecurity practices for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
2. **Upload** to Fleet using fleetctl
3. **Deploy** policies to your macOS 15 hosts
4. **Monitor** compliance in Fleet dashboard

## üìã What's Included

### üõ°Ô∏è **285+ Security Controls**
- **Level 1 (Essential)**: 76 fundamental cybersecurity practices for FCI protection
- **Level 2 (Advanced)**: 209 comprehensive cybersecurity practices for CUI protection
- **Complete coverage**: All CMMC domains and security control families

### üéØ **Coverage Areas**
- **Access Control (AC)**: User authentication, authorization, least privilege
- **Audit & Accountability (AU)**: System event monitoring, log management
- **Awareness & Training (AT)**: Security awareness and training requirements
- **Configuration Management (CM)**: Baseline configurations, change control
- **Identification & Authentication (IA)**: User identity verification, multi-factor authentication

## üîß Requirements

| Component | Version | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Fleet** | 4.0+ | Device management platform |
| **osquery** | 5.17.0+ | Query engine |
| **macOS** | 15.0+ | Target operating system |
| **Permissions** | Admin/Root | Required for system queries |

## üì¶ Installation

### Fleet CLI (fleetctl)
```bash
# Install fleetctl (update to release of your preferred platform)
curl -L https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/releases/latest/download/fleetctl_linux.tar.gz | tar xz

# Configure Fleet connection
fleetctl config set --address https://your-fleet-instance.com

# Upload CMMC Level 1 policies
fleetctl apply -f cmmc-policies-level-1.yml

# Upload CMMC Level 2 policies (includes Level 1)
fleetctl apply -f cmmc-policies-level-2.yml
```

### Direct osquery Testing
```bash
# Test individual policies with osqueryi
osqueryi "SELECT 1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM managed_policies WHERE domain = 'com.apple.security.smartcard');"

# Test with specific policy query
osqueryi -f cmmc-policies-level-1.yml
```

## ‚úÖ Validation & Testing

### Pre-Deployment Testing
```bash
# Validate YAML syntax
yamllint cmmc-policies-level-1.yml
yamllint cmmc-policies-level-2.yml

# Test queries locally
osqueryi --config_path=/etc/osquery/ --verbose
```

### Policy Verification
Each policy returns:
- **1** = **PASSING/COMPLIANT** (secure configuration detected)
- **0** = **FAILING/NON-COMPLIANT** (security issue found)

## üìä Policy Categories

### CMMC Level 1 (76 Policies)
| Section | Policies | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Authentication Controls** | 3 | Smartcard and SSH authentication |
| **iCloud & Data Protection** | 14 | Cloud service restrictions and data controls |
| **System Configuration** | 35 | System hardening and service controls |
| **System Settings & Security** | 24 | Security settings and privacy controls |

### CMMC Level 2 (209 Policies)
| Section | Policies | Level | Description |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Access Control** | 15 | 1 & 2 | User authentication and authorization |
| **Awareness & Training** | 3 | 2 | Security training requirements |
| **Audit & Accountability** | 30 | 2 | Comprehensive audit and logging |
| **Configuration Management** | 10 | 2 | System configuration control |
| **Identification & Authentication** | 12 | 1 & 2 | Identity verification and MFA |
| **Incident Response** | 7 | 2 | Security incident handling |
| **Maintenance** | 5 | 2 | System maintenance controls |
| **Media Protection** | 9 | 2 | Removable media and data protection |
| **Personnel Security** | 6 | 2 | Personnel screening and controls |
| **Physical Protection** | 11 | 2 | Physical access controls |
| **Risk Assessment** | 6 | 2 | Vulnerability and risk management |
| **Security Assessment** | 8 | 2 | Continuous monitoring |
| **System & Communications Protection** | 25 | 1 & 2 | Network security and encryption |
| **System & Information Integrity** | 12 | 1 & 2 | Malware protection and integrity |
| **macOS-Specific Controls** | 52 | 1 & 2 | Platform-specific hardening |

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Modifying Policies
1. **Edit queries** in the YAML file to match your environment
2. **Adjust tags** for custom categorization
3. **Update descriptions** for organization-specific guidance

### Example Customization
```yaml
# Custom remediation for your environment
resolution: |
  Run the following command on your systems:
  /usr/local/bin/your-config-tool --cmmc-compliance --enable
```

### Environment-Specific Adjustments
- **Development**: Disable certain strict policies that may impact development workflows
- **Production**: Enable all Level 2 policies for maximum security
- **Compliance**: Enable all policies for audit requirements
