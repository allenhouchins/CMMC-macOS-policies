# CMMC Level 2 Security Policies for Fleet - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION
# Based on US CMMC 2.0 Level 2 requirements from the usnistgov/macos_security project
# Compatible with Fleet and osquery - ALL 167 CMMC LEVEL 2 RULES
#
# USAGE:
# 1. Upload this YAML file to Fleet using fleetctl apply -f cmmc-policies-level-2.yml
# 2. Apply these policies to macOS hosts through Fleet teams/targeting
# 3. Review policy results in the Fleet dashboard
# 4. Use the resolution steps to remediate failing policies
#
# TOTAL COVERAGE: 167 CMMC Level 2 Rules
# ✅ Auditing: 26 policies | ✅ Authentication: 8 policies | ✅ iCloud: 14 policies
# ✅ macOS: 47 policies | ✅ Password Policy: 11 policies | ✅ System Settings: 40 policies  
# ✅ Inherent: 13 policies | ✅ Permanent: 3 policies | ✅ Not Applicable: 3 policies | ✅ Supplemental: 2 policies
